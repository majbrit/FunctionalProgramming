# Functional Programming Project
*Instructions for starting our project: https://www.notion.so/Installation-Description-b66417a057e7493dbe1d4c6aa75fdf86 or [Installation_Description.pdf](https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/Installation_Description.pdf)*

## Programme for showing pizza data
In order to run the programme, some installations have to be done. For this we have prepared an installation description. It can be found on Notion https://www.notion.so/Installation-Description-b66417a057e7493dbe1d4c6aa75fdf86 and in the Github project itself [Installation_Description.pdf](https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/Installation_Description.pdf). In two places in the description our code has to be inserted, to be found on the Notion pages linked in the description and in the Github project itself as [FP-Project.cabal](https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/FP-Project.cabal) and [Main.hs](https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/Main.hs).

The main part of the project is to read in a remote JSON file using a URL. The data is stored as a Person data type. In each Person, the first name, last name, age and whether the person likes pizza is stored. 

When the programme is started, the list of persons is output in JSON format and each person is presented in the form of a sentence.  The user is asked for his or her name. The input is stored in a variable and used in the next question to address the user directly. The user is asked if he or she likes pizza. If the answer is "yes" or "Yes", "Ahhh" is output, otherwise "Wrong answer".
