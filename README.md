# Functional Programming Project
*Instructions for starting our project: https://www.notion.so/Installation-Description-b66417a057e7493dbe1d4c6aa75fdf86 or https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/Installation_Description.pdf*

## Programme for showing pizza data
In order to run the programme, some installations have to be done. For this we have prepared an installation description. It can be found on Notion https://www.notion.so/Installation-Description-b66417a057e7493dbe1d4c6aa75fdf86 and in the Github project itself [Installation_Description.pdf](https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/Installation_Description.pdf). In two places in the description our code has to be inserted, to be found on the Notion pages linked in the description and in the Github project itself as [FP-Project.cabal](https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/FP-Project.cabal) and [Main.hs](https://github.com/majbrit/FunctionalProgramming/blob/main/Main.hs).
